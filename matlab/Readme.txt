This is a package of high-resoltion spectral estimation tools based on state-covariance. It includes basic routines and some command for specializd plotting. We provide a brief introduction for the routines.

cjordan  	--- generates a controllable pair for input-to-state filter with complex valued input
rjordan  	--- generates a controllable pair for input-to-state filter with real valued input
mjordan  	--- a multi-dimensional version with Jordan block-matrix



dlsim_real     --- computes state statistics with real valued input
dlsim_complex  --- computes state statistics with complex valued input
commutant      --- projects the state stattistics into the state-covariance space 



me             --- maximum entropy method for spectral estimation
sm             --- subspace method
envlp          --- spectral envelop

music          --- MUSIC spectral estimation method
esprit         --- ESPRIT method

MA_decomp      --- decomposes a Toeplitz matrix into additive of a moving average covariance and a singular one
